                <h4 class="our_names">Benjamin High</h4>
                <p>Ben is a BackEnd Software Developer and Karaoke connoisseur. However, due to the outrageous price of
                Karaoke software, parties he hosted often ended up with a sticky note queue and youtube searches.
                unorganization of that process left Ben thinking there had to be a better way, and The Karaoke Man was
                born.</p>

                  <p>Austin is a FrontEnd Software Developer and Graphic Designer. After hearing about the idea of The Karaoke Man,
                    offered his services to the development of the app. He created The Karaoke Man logo, and designed the
                    majority of the site, while also using Javascript to make components dynamic.</p>
